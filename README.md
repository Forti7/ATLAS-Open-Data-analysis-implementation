This repository contains the necessary files to perform the different implementations of the ATLAS Open Data analysis presented on the thesis. All of them contain the necessary `infofile.py` to run the ATLAS code.
## Implementation on REANA
Contains the ATLAS source code adapted to be implemented on REANA. The necessary `reana.yaml` file is also there.

## Implementation on C4P and S4P
Contains the ATLAS source code adapted to be implemented on C4P and S4P, eventhough the implementation was yet possible in the moment of creating this repository, so further changes to this files might be necessary once the implementation is possible. . The necessary `reana-c4p.yaml` file is also there.

## Modification for combined analysis
Contains the ATLAS source code with some rough modifications to enable the code to produce a ROOT file containing the resulting histograms of the analysis. This histograms have been adapted to be compatible with the histograms of the CMS Open Data analysis as a step towards the combination of both analysis in a near future.
